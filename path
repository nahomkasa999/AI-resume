The most important feature is the **Resume Builder Core** - that's exactly what users come for! They want to create their resume quickly and easily. Everything else (authentication, dashboard, etc.) is secondary to this core functionality.

Let's break down the Resume Builder priorities:

1. **Template Selection Page**
   - Display all templates
   - Preview functionality
   - Easy selection process
   - Filter/categorize templates

2. **Resume Editor**
   - Essential sections:
     - Personal Information (name, contact, location)
     - Professional Summary
     - Work Experience
     - Education
     - Skills
   - Real-time preview
   - Easy-to-use form inputs
   - Drag & drop section reordering

3. **Export/Download**
   - PDF download
   - Basic formatting options
   - Preview before download

This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach - build what users absolutely need first. After this core functionality works well, we can add:
- Authentication (to save resumes)
- Dashboard (to manage multiple resumes)
- Advanced features (AI assistance, cover letters, etc.)
- Analytics and other extras

Would you like to start with:
1. Template selection page setup?
2. Resume editor interface?
3. Basic export functionality?

Let me know which part of the core builder you want to tackle first!

Ah, now I understand your question better. For automating the resume building process, here's how we should structure it:

1. **Template System Architecture**
   - JSON-based template structure
   - Dynamic component rendering
   - Section-based builder
   - Real-time preview

2. **Builder Flow**:
```
User Journey:
1. Select Template
2. Fill Information
   ├─ Personal Details
   ├─ Professional Summary (AI-assisted)
   ├─ Work Experience
   ├─ Education
   ├─ Skills
   └─ Custom Sections
3. Real-time Preview
4. Download/Save
```

3. **Key Components Needed**:
   - Template Engine (converts JSON to HTML/PDF)
   - Form Builder (dynamic form generation)
   - Preview Renderer
   - PDF Generator
   - Data Management System

4. **Technologies to Use**:
   - React-PDF for PDF generation
   - TipTap or Draft.js for rich text editing
   - html2canvas for preview
   - jsPDF for final export
   - OpenAI API for AI assistance

5. **Implementation Steps**:
```
Step 1: Builder Interface
├─ Split-screen layout
│  ├─ Left: Form inputs
│  └─ Right: Live preview
├─ Drag-and-drop section reordering
└─ Real-time updates

Step 2: Template System
├─ Component-based structure
├─ Style configurations
└─ Layout management

Step 3: Data Management
├─ Form state management
├─ Auto-save functionality
└─ Version control

Step 4: Export System
├─ PDF generation
├─ Multiple format support
└─ Download management
```

Would you like me to:
1. Start with the builder interface setup?
2. Create the template engine structure?
3. Set up the PDF generation system?
4. Implement the form builder?

Ah, now I understand! Let's map out the complete user flow:

```
Landing Page → Template Selection → Resume Builder → Download/Save
```

Detailed Flow:

1. **Landing Page**
   - User clicks any "Create Resume" button
   - Redirects to `/templates`

2. **Template Selection Page** (`/templates`)
   - User browses templates
   - Clicks "Use This Template"
   - Redirects to `/builder?template=template_id`

3. **Resume Builder Page** (`/builder`)
   - Left side: Form inputs
   - Right side: Live preview
   - Sections:
     - Personal Info
     - Professional Summary
     - Work Experience
     - Education
     - Skills
   - Save/Download options

Let's create this flow:

1. First, we already have the landing page and template selection
2. Next, we need to create:
```
app/
├── builder/
│   └── page.jsx    # Resume builder interface
├── templates/
│   └── page.jsx    # Template selection (already done)
└── page.js         # Landing page (already done)
```

Would you like me to:
1. Create the builder page layout?
2. Set up the routing between pages?
3. Implement the template-to-builder connection?
4. Add the form and preview system?

Let me know which part you want to implement first, and I'll provide the specific code!

The key is making sure each step flows smoothly into the next, with clear navigation and state management between pages.
For resume templates, here are some good sources:

1. **Figma Community** (Best Option)
   - [Resume Builder Templates](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1135661327912633364/resume-builder-templates)
   - [Professional Resume Templates](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1100001227858833123)
   - We can export these as images for our template preview
   - Easy to convert to React components
   - Free to use commercially

2. **Open Source Templates**
   - [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/themes/)
   - GitHub resume templates
   - These are good for structure reference

3. **Resume.io Templates** (For Inspiration)
   - We can look at their template structure
   - Design our own similar versions

Steps to implement:

1. First, let's download/create 6-8 template previews from Figma
2. Save them in our project:
```
public/
└── templates/
    ├── professional-1.png
    ├── professional-2.png
    ├── creative-1.png
    ├── modern-1.png
    ├── simple-1.png
    └── executive-1.png
```

3. Then update our templates page with real templates:
```javascript:app/templates/page.jsx
const templates = [
  {
    id: 'professional-1',
    name: 'Professional Classic',
    category: 'professional',
    image: '/templates/professional-1.png',
    popularity: '410,000+ users',
    description: 'Perfect for experienced professionals',
    features: ['ATS-Friendly', 'Clean Layout', 'Professional Tone']
  },
  // Add more templates...
];
```

Would you like me to:
1. Share specific Figma template links we can use?
2. Create the template preview components?
3. Set up the template grid layout?
4. Implement the template filtering system?

Let me know which direction you'd prefer, and I can provide more detailed implementation steps!
